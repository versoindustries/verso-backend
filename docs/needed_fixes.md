Directive Notes: 

- All react and Jinja2 should be Enterprise Level UX and Enterprise Level and World Class Design Theory UI.
- Before you perform any work, make sure analyze all relating code. 

http://localhost:5000/my-account?tab=appointments

Notes: User needs to be able to reschedule, cancel, etc on this page. Currently they cannot. 

http://localhost:5000/admin/booking

Notes: This does not appear to be fully designed with css within the react. Still appears generic. Should be using the base reference color schemes that ties into the base.css or similar for react and it should be Enterprise Level UX and Enterprise Level and World Class Design Theory UI.

http://localhost:5000/admin/data-management

Notes: Needs full redesign with Enterprise Level UX and Enterprise Level and World Class Design Theory UI.

http://localhost:5000/messaging/

- Needs full redesign with Enterprise Level UX and Enterprise Level and World Class Design Theory UI. Also, does not appear to be an enterprise level solution that's fully enhanced. Should be able to set private channels where only certain roles or added users can access it. Public channels should also have controls for setting role based access, and the regular user should have access to Channels that users set them to have access to but they cannot create their own channels. I want this to be fully analyzed over and put together it's own feature enhancement and redesign and execute on it.

http://localhost:5000/admin/analytics/traffic
http://localhost:5000/admin/analytics/visitors
http://localhost:5000/admin/analytics/sessions
http://localhost:5000/admin/analytics/funnels

- These 5 Need full redesign with Enterprise Level UX and Enterprise Level and World Class Design Theory UI. Similar to other admin based dashboard tasks, I need you to fully unify this and enhance it as much as possible. There should be far more controls over it and some of that functionality doesn't appear to be working correctly. Fully analyze this over and put together it's own feature enhancement and redesign and execute on it.

http://localhost:5000/admin/dashboard

- Appointments calendar specifically needs enhanced so it looks like the calendar http://localhost:5000/calendar/view which is far more enhanced. Need full redesign with Enterprise Level UX and Enterprise Level and World Class Design Theory UI.

http://localhost:5000/employee/dashboard

- Need full redesign with Enterprise Level UX and Enterprise Level and World Class Design Theory UI. Also, the employee dashboard should also have a calendar view of all the appointments/bookings that they are involved in. Fully analyze this over and put together it's own feature enhancement and redesign and execute on it.

http://localhost:5000/calendar/view
http://localhost:5000/admin/dashboard
http://localhost:5000/employee/dashboard

- Make sure these all correctly show appointments and all tracking of them is being monitored correctly. 

http://localhost:5000/admin/shop/orders
http://localhost:5000/admin/shop/products

- These need to be unified into an enterprise level react dashboard like we've been doing with the rest of the functionality. Then make sure you get rid of any old code that doesn't relate. Need full redesign with Enterprise Level UX and Enterprise Level and World Class Design Theory UI. Fully analyze this over and put together it's own feature enhancement and redesign and execute on it.

- Need full redesign with Enterprise Level UX and Enterprise Level and World Class Design Theory UI.

http://localhost:5000/admin/user-management
http://localhost:5000/admin/locations

- Under User management, we need to be able to set a location for the users so they can only see the data that relates to them or their location such as shop orders, appointments/bookings, etc. Means that the booking will need slightly modified to track location selection if they have multiple locations. Also should be a locations page that shows the locations of the business, needs to follow our seo guidelines in the docs and the prompts we put together for those. Fully analyze this over and put together it's own feature enhancement and redesign and execute on it. Need full redesign with Enterprise Level UX and Enterprise Level and World Class Design Theory UI. 

- Owner Role: Make sure anything the Owner should be managing and taking care of is integrated into the admin dashboard and only shows up if they have the Owner role. I would likely think setting admin permissions, locations, etc should be done by the owner role primarily. I need a quality setup for this.

Other notes: Meta tags, written copy, and page images are supposed to be editable after launch. The Admin, Manager, Marketing, and Owner roles should be able to edit these. It should be built in react and when logged in, they should be able to click a widget that allows them to edit any page when they're on page.
