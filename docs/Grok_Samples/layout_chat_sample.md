### Modern Design Elements
- **Typography**: Use a sans-serif font (e.g., Open Sans, Roboto) with clear hierarchy—larger, bold headings (h2 for section titles, h3 for feature titles) and readable paragraph text.
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacers (e.g., `section-spacer` and `small-spacer`) between sections for a clean, airy feel.
- **Grid Layout**: The features section uses a responsive grid (CSS Grid or Flexbox) that adjusts columns based on screen size (e.g., 1 column on mobile, 3 on desktop).
- **Interactivity**: 
  - Lighthouse gallery provides lightbox functionality for feature images, with lazy loading for performance.
  - Hover effects on feature cards enhance user engagement.
- **Visuals**: Thumbnail images in the gallery tie into the content, with placeholders assumed (e.g., "auth-thumb.jpg", "db-large.jpg")—replace with relevant screenshots or diagrams in implementation.
- **Responsiveness**: The layout stacks vertically on smaller screens, with the gallery grid adapting seamlessly.

---

### How the Lighthouse Gallery JavaScript is Used
The Lighthouse gallery JavaScript, as provided in the existing HTML, is leveraged in the "What You Can Do with Flask" section:
- **Gallery Container**: The `#gallery-container` holds the feature cards, where each card’s image is wrapped in an anchor tag (e.g., `<a href="large-image.jpg"><img src="thumbnail.jpg" class="lazy"></a>`).
- **Functionality**: 
  - Clicking an image opens the lightbox with the larger version, enhancing the visual exploration of features.
  - Lazy loading ensures images load only when in view, optimizing performance.
  - The existing script handles lightbox display, closing, and lazy loading, requiring no additional JavaScript for this layout.
- **Purpose**: It transforms static feature descriptions into an interactive gallery, making the content more engaging and visually rich.

---

### Notes
- **Image Placeholders**: The layout assumes image paths (e.g., `images/features/auth-thumb.jpg`). In practice, replace these with actual assets related to each feature.
- **Load More Functionality**: The existing JavaScript includes a "load more" feature, but since the content is static with seven features, it’s not utilized here. It could be added for scalability if more features are introduced later.
- **Styling**: While no CSS is provided, assume modern practices: CSS Grid for the features section, flexbox for responsiveness, and subtle animations (e.g., fade-ins) for a polished look.

This layout effectively combines the written content with the Lighthouse gallery JavaScript, maintaining the hero section and delivering a modern, user-friendly design for promoting Verso Backend and Flask.
