## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

Most small-to-medium businesses are bleeding **$12,000–$25,000/year** on fragmented SaaS tools that don't talk to each other:

| What You're Paying For | Typical Monthly Cost |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce) | $200–$500/mo |
| Scheduling (Calendly, Acuity) | $100–$200/mo |
| Email Marketing (Mailchimp, Klaviyo) | $100–$300/mo |
| Team Chat (Slack, Teams) | $150–$250/mo |
| HR Portal (BambooHR) | $100–$200/mo |
| Forms/Surveys (Typeform) | $50–$100/mo |
| CMS/Blog (WordPress hosting) | $50–$150/mo |
| **Total Integration Tax** | **$750–$1,700/mo** |

**Verso replaces all of this with one self-hosted system you actually own.**

---

## 💡 The Verso Philosophy

> **"Server-side truth. Single latency domain. No rent-seeking dependencies."**

Verso is not a starter kit. It's a **production-grade modular monolith** built on boring, battle-tested technology that will still run in 2035:

- **Python + Flask** — The world's most readable backend language
- **SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL/SQLite** — ACID-compliant data you control
- **Jinja2 SSR + React Islands** — Zero hydration errors, progressive enhancement
- **Your Server** — VPS, bare metal, Raspberry Pi, air-gapped facility

**We optimize for:** Unit economics, operational sovereignty, long-term maintainability

**We reject:** Framework churn, per-seat pricing, vendor lock-in, "serverless" roulette

---

## 💰 Economic Comparison

### Year 1 Cost: Typical SaaS Stack vs. Verso

| Scenario | SaaS Stack (15 employees) | Verso (Self-Hosted) |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Monthly Software** | $1,500/mo | $0 |
| **Hosting** | $150/mo (variable) | $20–$40/mo (fixed) |
| **Setup/Migration** | $0 | $2,500–$5,000 (one-time) |
| **Year 1 Total** | **$19,800** | **$3,240–$5,480** |
| **Year 2+ Total** | **$19,800/yr** | **$240–$480/yr** |

> **ROI:** Verso pays for itself in **60–90 days**. Every year after, you keep the $15,000+.

---

## ✅ What Verso Replaces

### The "Annoying Stack" We Eliminate

| Category | Tools You're Paying For | Verso Equivalent |
|----------|------------------------|------------------|
| **CRM & Leads** | HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive | Built-in CRM with pipeline stages |
| **Scheduling** | Calendly, Acuity, Jobber | Full booking system with staff availability |
| **Email Marketing** | Mailchimp, Klaviyo, Constant Contact | Campaigns, templates, drip sequences |
| **Team Messaging** | Slack, Microsoft Teams | Channels, threads, @mentions, emoji reactions |
| **Forms & Surveys** | Typeform, JotForm, Google Forms | Dynamic form builder + NPS/CSAT |
| **Website/Blog** | WordPress, Contentful, Squarespace | Full CMS with SEO, JSON-LD, sitemaps |
| **HR Portal** | BambooHR (basic), Gusto (HR only) | Leave requests, time tracking, employee directory |
| **Analytics** | Mixpanel, GA | Built-in visitor tracking & conversion funnels |

### What We **Don't** Replace

| System | Why | Our Approach |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| **Accounting** (QuickBooks, Xero) | Critical financial infrastructure | Keep it. We don't touch your books. |
| **Payroll** (Gusto, ADP) | Heavily regulated, compliance risk | Keep it. Use our HR portal alongside. |
| **Deep Inventory/ERP** | Complex enterprise systems | Keep it. We handle orders and CRM. |

## 🔄 Staying Updated

Verso-Backend receives regular updates with new features, security patches, and improvements. To pull updates without losing your customizations:

```bash
# First time: Add upstream remote (if you cloned from template)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/versoindustries/verso-backend.git

flask db upgrade
npm run build
```

> **Tip:** Keep customizations in clearly marked files (e.g., `custom.css`, `theme-overrides.css`) to minimize merge conflicts. Files like `.env` and `app/static/images/logo.png` are configured in `.gitattributes` to favor your version during merges.
